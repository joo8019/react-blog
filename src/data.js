        description:"The initial plan was to release Adipurush in not just 2D and 3D versions but also in the IMAX format. This plan was subsequently dropped, however. A source told Bollywood Hungama, “Adipurush is arguably the grandest film ever made in India. The makers felt that it’s apt that it gets a release in the IMAX screens. The source continued, “However, that won’t be possible as Warner Bros’ superhero film The Flash also releases on the same day and they had booked the IMAX screens way in advance. As per the IMAX rulebook, two IMAX films can’t be released on the same day. As a result, the decision to release Adipurush in IMAX theatres was shelved."
